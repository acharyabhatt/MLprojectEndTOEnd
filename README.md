Introduction

    In this project, we aim to predict students' performance based on various attributes. This involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.


Dataset

    The dataset used in this project is the Kaggle dataset, which contains several features such as gender, parental education level, test preparation course, and scores in various subjects.   



Installation

    To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt


Usage

    Data Preprocessing: Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data.


    Exploratory Data Analysis: Perform EDA to understand the data.


    Feature Engineering: Engineer features to improve model performance.


    Model Training: Train the machine learning models.


    Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained models.


Results

    The results of the analysis and the performance of the machine learning models will be documented in the Results section. This will include various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
